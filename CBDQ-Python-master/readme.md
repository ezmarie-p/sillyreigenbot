# No longer updated as of : 2024/02/07. Replaced with [AGORI Bots](https://bots.agori.dev)

# CheapBotsDoneQuick-like python bot for Twitter

## Why? 

Because of the recent suspension of CBDQ API Access, I am making a script that can simulate the same behavior as the CBDQ bots. This script is obviously a very wip. JSON schemas are exactly the same as the CBDQ bots, so you can just copy and paste the JSON files from the CBDQ bots into the same directory as this script and a few script changes and you're good to go.

## [How to host (Via Replit)](host.md)

## How to use
- Git clone the source code (Or use source download)
- download all libs needed: `pip install tweepy` and `pip install Pillow`
- Put your bot.json in `src/` and run the script!

- Libraries used:
    - tweepy
    - python-dotenv

- Note: Not all CBDQ functions are added yet! Please request more features! (Will need an example on how it works so i can implement it)

### The [tracery](src/tracery.py) class is free for use. You may use it if you wish ðŸ™‚
